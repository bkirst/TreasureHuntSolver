Features/Bugs
- Simulation is getting way too many turns
	- Make sure we're dropping the first four gem types not 3
	- I'm not sure if the cascade clear counts after the first one are matching actual game behavior
- Need to implement board shuffle on 0 match case
- Multithread simulation
- Improve image matching speed
	- Maybe evaluate using an actual library
- Statistical move evaluation based on chance of hitting a 4 or 5 cascade
- Machine learning integration investigation

Maintenance
- log4j integration and log levels
- unit test library and convert existing tests
- unit test coverage for all the other classes
